# Sperm-TH_Markov-Motility
ABM in Netlogo that simulates sperm motility states as a time-homogeneous markov process
Netlogo V6.2.2

## Features: 
> Simulates 'self-separating' properties of sperm populatons due to variation in sperm phenotype distribution
> Allows for designation of up to five sperm subpopulation types. Progressive, intermediate, hyperactive, slow, and weakly motile.
> Capable of reporting histogram distributions of curvilinear velocity for individual sperm. Recommend binning equal to number of sperm in the simulation.
> Accompanying maze draw model allows custom design of input spatial barriers. Sperm agents will avoid barriers. 
> Note that the spatial environment can only be loaded in if the .txt file is named File IO PATCH DATA.txt. The accompanying files can have the _* removed for automatic loading.
